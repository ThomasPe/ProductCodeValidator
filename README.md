Product Code Validator
================

The "Product Code Validator" project aims to facilitate the validation of product identifiers such as EAN, ISBN or ASIN by checking, if a tested value matches the required format.

Attention: This code will not check, if a product really exists. It just validates a code that could be a product!

There are still quite a few things missing, especially code documentation.
Feel free to add support of further product code types.

Currently supported:

 - EAN
 - ASIN
 - ISBN
 - UPC
